              <h4>Why?</h4>
              I used to hate following recipes while baking. Then at some point I realized how much better things tasted when I did. I even came to believe that the best ever recipe for chocolate chip cookies was printed on the back of the Toll House chocolate chips package. (I might still believe that.)
            </p>
            <p>
              And then I saw <a href="http://sweets.seriouseats.com/2013/12/the-food-lab-the-best-chocolate-chip-cookies.html">Kenji's amazing break-down</a> of how different ingredients affect cookie attributes. (I made <a href="https://mobeets.github.io/cookies/">this</a> app to summarize his findings for quick reference.) I was impressed, but still, I didn't improvise when I made cookies. I made the same exact cookies every single time.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm not like Kenji: I would never bake something over and over again and manually note the effects of changing the proportions between flour and baking soda. Instead, I wanted to make something automatic&mdash;something that could tell me how much of an ingredient I could add to or subtract from a recipe before things would start to taste wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
              <h4>So what's an Autocookie?</h4>
              Autocookie collects a bunch of recipes for the same type of food&mdash;chocolate chip cookies, to start&mdash;and finds the range of acceptable ingredient ratios. To continue my flour and baking soda example, if one recipe called for 2 cups of flour and 1 tsp of baking soda, that's a ratio of 2.0 cups/tsp. If another recipe called for 1.5 cups of flour and 2 tsp of baking soda, that's a ratio of 0.75 cups/tsp. All Autocookie does, then, is suggest proportions of baking soda and flour that stay within this range of 0.75-2.0 cups/tsp. Just expand this same idea to all ingredient combinations, across multiple recipes.
            </p>
            <p>
              <h4>Future work</h4>
              Given the messiness of recipe databases, I ended up parsing my recipe ingredient lists myself. I tried the NYTimes's <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/ingredient-phrase-tagger">ingredient phrase tagger</a>, but in my case, because I was focused on a specific type of recipes&mdash;cookies&mdash;it ended up being easier to just roll my own ingredients parser.
            </p>
            <p>
              Though my recipe parsing is automated I decided to aim for quality over quantity (for once) and only include recipes I've sanity-checked. However, this app could be easily modified to include different types of recipes. For instructions on this, see the README <a href="https://github.com/mobeets/autocookie">here</a>. To get the recipes themselves, you'll need access to the Yummly <a href="https://developer.yummly.com">recipe API</a>. (This is free and simple, if you're a student.)
            </p>
            <p>
              One thing I've learned from working with recipe data is that there's a lot of redundancy out there. The difference between the Hershey's and Toll House chocolate chip cookie recipes, for example, is literally only 1/2 a teaspoon of salt. In a world where anyone can change ingredients by 1/2 a teaspoon and call it a new recipe, someone's got to step up and summarize all this data. A visualization like Autocookie is a start.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some other things I would like to add in the future:
              <ul>
                <li>Better unit conversion (e.g., things like "3 tsp" should be "1 Tbsp")</li>
                <li>Add/remove ingredients (my current code is too janky to support this)</li>
                <li>A way to scale outputs for different serving sizes</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
